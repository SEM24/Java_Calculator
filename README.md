# Java_Calculator
At the entrance of the program in program arguments(String[] args) the first parameter is a mathematical expression
The other parameters look like the name of the variable = value, for example a = 2
We have to parse the expression one time and then to calculate the result of mathematical task
(if we parse one time, it will be faster, than every time)
Example of expression: 62*5+a-9/b+47/2^2-5 a=4.5 b=2
